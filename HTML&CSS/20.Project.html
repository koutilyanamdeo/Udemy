            <div><p> Child labour is the use of children in producing goods and services. They are
                   employed by the producers at minimal wages, which makes them susceptible to violence
                   and any unjust activity. They are paid minimal wages and are made to work for almost
                   nine hours in a day. The procedure of converting them to child labour is easy. The 
                   parents themselves want the children to get involved in such activities. These parents 
                   cannot generate the basic income necessary for sustaining themselves. The parents are 
                   helpless. However, some parents do not want to bear the burden of having too many
                    children and giving their last child to these factory owners.</p></div>
