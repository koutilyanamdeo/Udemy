            <p> Child labour is the use of children in producing goods and services. They are employed by the producers at minimal wages, which makes them susceptible to violenceand any unjust activity. They are paid 
                minimal wages and are made to work for almost nine hours in a day. The procedure of converting them to child labour is easy. The parents themselves want the children to get involved in such activities.
                These parents cannot generate the basic income necessary for sustaining themselves. The parents are helpless. However, some parents do not want to bear the burden of having too many children and giving their 
                last child to these factory owners. </p>
